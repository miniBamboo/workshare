# Luckyshare

Luckyshare区块链，让每个人都可以有ticket制作智能合约或dApp.

这是用golang编写的第一个实现，现在是v0.01版，暂时还不能用.

Luckyshare的目标是我为人人，人人为我----也就是*共享*.

因此，谁要在luckyshare上制作智能合约或dApp，谁就要长时间运行一个luckyshare节点，云节点或者nat节点都可以。

Luckyshare区块链与以太坊的生态系统兼容。.

## Installation

### Requirements

Luckyshare requires `Go` 1.13+ and `C` compiler to build. To install `Go`, follow this [link](https://golang.org/doc/install). 

### Getting the source

Clone the Luckyshare repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/miniBamboo/luckyshare.git
cd luckyshare
```

### Dependency management

Simply run:
```
make dep
```

If you keep getting network error, it is suggested to use [Go Module Proxy](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_proxy_protocol). [https://proxy.golang.org/](https://proxy.golang.org/) is one option.

### Building

To build the main app `luckyshare`, just run

```
make
```

or build the full suite:

```
make all
```

If no error reported, all built executable binaries will appear in folder *bin*.

## Running Luckyshare

Connect to Luckyshare's mainnet:

```
bin/luckyshare --network main
```


Connect to Luckyshare's testnet:

```
bin/luckyshare --network test
```

or startup a custom network
```
bin/luckyshare --network <custom-net-genesis.json>
```



To find out usages of all command line options:

```
bin/luckyshare -h
```

- `--network value`             the network to join (main|test) or path to genesis file
- `--data-dir value`            directory for block-chain databases
- `--cache value`               megabytes of ram allocated to internal caching (default: 2048)
- `--beneficiary value`         address for block rewards
- `--target-gas-limit value`    target block gas limit (adaptive if set to 0) (default: 0)
- `--api-addr value`            API service listening address (default: "localhost:51991")
- `--api-cors value`            comma separated list of domains from which to accept cross origin requests to API
- `--api-timeout value`         API request timeout value in milliseconds (default: 10000)
- `--api-call-gas-limit value`  limit contract call gas (default: 50000000)
- `--api-backtrace-limit value` limit the distance between 'position' and best block for subscriptions APIs (default: 1000)
- `--verbosity value`           log verbosity (0-9) (default: 3)
- `--max-peers value`           maximum number of P2P network peers (P2P network disabled if set to 0) (default: 25)
- `--p2p-port value`            P2P network listening port (default: 11235)
- `--nat value`                 port mapping mechanism (any|none|upnp|pmp|extip:<IP>) (default: "none")
- `--bootnode value`            comma separated list of bootnode IDs
- `--skip-logs`                 skip writing event|transfer logs (/logs API will be disabled)
- `--pprof`                     turn on go-pprof

- `--help, -h`                  show help
- `--version, -v`               print the version

### Sub-commands

- `solo`                client runs in solo mode for test & dev

```
bin/luckyshare solo --on-demand               # create new block when there is pending transaction
bin/luckyshare solo --persist                 # save blockchain data to disk(default to memory)
bin/luckyshare solo --persist --on-demand     # two options can work together
```

- `master-key`          master key management

```
# print the master address
bin/luckyshare master-key

# export master key to keystore
bin/luckyshare master-key --export > keystore.json


# import master key from keystore
cat keystore.json | bin/luckyshare master-key --import
```

## Docker

Docker is one quick way for running a Luckyshare node:

```
docker run -d\
  -v {path-to-your-data-directory}/.link.luckyshare.chain:/root/.link.luckyshare.chain\
  -p 127.0.0.1:51991:51991 -p 11235:11235 -p 11235:11235/udp\
  --name luckyshare-node miniBamboo/luckyshare --network test
```

Do not forget to add the `--api-addr 0.0.0.0:51991` flag if you want other containers and/or hosts to have access to the RESTful API. `luckyshare`binds to `localhost` by default and it will not accept requests outside the container itself without the flag.





## API

Once `luckyshare` started, online *OpenAPI* doc can be accessed in your browser. e.g. http://localhost:51991/ by default.

## Contributing

Thanks you so much for considering to help out with the source code! We welcome contributions from anyone on the internet, and are grateful for even the smallest of fixes!

Please fork, fix, commit and send a pull request for the maintainers to review and merge into the main code base.

### Forking Luckyshare
When you "Fork" the project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours; it lives in your namespace, and you can push to it.

### Getting ready for a pull request
Please check the following:

- Code must be adhere to the official Go Formatting guidelines.
- Get the branch up to date, by merging in any recent changes from the master branch.

### Making the pull request
- On the GitHub site, go to "Code". Then click the green "Compare and Review" button. Your branch is probably in the "Example Comparisons" list, so click on it. If not, select it for the "compare" branch.
- Make sure you are comparing your new branch to master. It probably won't be, since the front page is the latest release branch, rather than master now. So click the base branch and change it to master.
- Press Create Pull Request button.
- Give a brief title.
- Explain the major changes you are asking to be code reviewed. Often it is useful to open a second tab in your browser where you can look through the diff yourself to remind yourself of all the changes you have made.
